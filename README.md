## Slick Slider Usage
The required slick files are contained in the ```components/slick-slider``` folder:
1. CSS file needs to be included in the ```<head>```
2. Add slick.js before your closing ```</body>``` tag (slick depends on jQuery)
### HTML Markup
```
<div class="your-class">
  <div>your content</div>
  <div>your content</div>
  <div>your content</div>
</div>
```
### Initialization
```
$('.your-class').slick();
```
## The Exercise
Modify the 'Corus Theme' to add the following functionality:
* Add a custom post type called "gallery". This post type will ONLY have the following fields
    * Title (default WordPress field)
    * Slider Image 1 (Image upload field)
    * Slider Image 2 (Image upload field)
    * Slider Image 3 (Image upload field)
* Use **Advanced Custom Fields** to create the three slider image fields (plugin provided in the repo)
* Create a single post-type page to output the gallery images based on the post_id.
* Using slick slider [http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) output the three images to create the "single item" carousel
